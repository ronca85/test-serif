GitLab Community Edition
========================

GitLab is a full-featured DevOps platform that can be used to manage all aspects from application development through build and deployment. The implementation of Git source code management (SCM) system is one of the main features among multiple features it offers out-of-the-box. GitLab has a community edition which is open-source and free, and a licensed enterprise edition that has extra features. This AMI contains the community edition.

==================================================================================

*   When an EC2 node is spun up from this AMI, GitLab would be up and running on port 80 over HTTP.
*   Configure a CNAME for the instance and point that to the new instance. Example, gitlab.yourcompany.com.
*   When GitLab is accessed on the browser first time you will be asked to set the password for the administrative user `root`. Set that and login into the application to complete the configuration and initial set up such as creating source code repositories.
*   Refer official documentation for specific maintenance and configuration tasks [https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/)
