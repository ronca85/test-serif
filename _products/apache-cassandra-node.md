Apache Cassandra Node
=====================

Apache Cassandra is an open-source, distributed, wide-column store, NoSQL database management system designed to handle large amounts of data across many commodity servers, providing high availability with no single point of failure. Cassandra offers robust support for clusters spanning multiple datacenters, with asynchronous masterless replication allowing low latency operations for all clients. This AMI could be used for setting up a single node Cassandra installation or used as a node for setting up a multi-node Cassandra cluster.

====================================================================================

*   AMI built with Java 8 and the latest, stable version of Apache Cassandra.
*   AMI compatible for setting up both single node Cassandra and multi-node Cassandra clusters.
*   AMI built on a patched operating system and the node created from this is ready to be deployed in production.

============================================================================================

*   When an EC2 node spun up from this AMI, Cassandra service is up and running.
*   If the node has to be added to a cluster, do the additional configuration using user data script.

==============================================================================================

*   When an EC2 node spun up from this AMI, Cassandra service would be up and running on port 9042.
*   Depending on the configuration of the cluster to which the node has to join, more ports need to be opened as follows:

    Cassandra inter-node ports:
    7000	Cassandra inter-node cluster communication.
    7001	Cassandra SSL inter-node cluster communication.
    7199	Cassandra JMX monitoring port.
    
    Cassandra client ports:
    9042	Cassandra client port.
    9160	Cassandra client port (Thrift).
    9142	Default for native_transport_port_ssl, useful when both encrypted and unencrypted connections are required
    

*   The EC2 node would run a standalone Cassandra installation by default.
*   If the node has to be added to a cluster make suitable changes and restart the service.
*   The Cassandra installation is at /opt/cassandra/apache-cassandra-VERSION (e.g. /opt/cassandra/apache-cassandra-3.11.10).
*   On platforms supporting systemd the `cassandra` service can managed using standard steps:

On older Linux platforms like Amazon Linux 2018, standard `cassandra` service is available to manage the service:

*   At times, especially when smaller instance types are used for spinning up the EC2 node the Cassandra might fail to start. In such cases, manually start the Cassandra service.
*   /opt/cassandra/apache-cassandra-VERSION/bin is in the global PATH and all the Cassandra binaries like `nodetool` can be run without specifying the full path.
*   The Cassandra service is configured run as user `cassandra`. Any configuration change should take that into account.
