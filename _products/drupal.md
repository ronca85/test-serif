Drupal Content Management System
================================

Drupal is a free and open-source content-management system (CMS) that is flexible and multilingual. It can be customized to run simple websites through complex web applications. With thousands of free modules and themes Drupal based websites will help you attract the audience you need to deliver your message, grow brand awareness, and build your community. This is a repackaged open source software product wherein additional charges apply for support by Kurian.

This AMI is built using the latest versions of Apache, MariaDB database and PHP on the target Linux operating system (LAMP stack) that is patched with updates. The MariaDB database is secured to prevent any unwanted access for increased security. When a machine is spun up using this AMI Drupal would be up and running and ready for configuring for your specific requirements.
