Joomla! Content Management System
=================================

Joomla is an award winning, free and open source content management system (CMS) for publishing web content. It is built on a model view controller web application framework that can be used independently of the CMS that allows you to build powerful online applications. It can be used for building variety of websites like corporate websites or portals, intranets and extranets, small business websites, online magazines, newspapers and publications, eCommerce and online reservations, government, nonprofit and organizational websites, community based, school and church websites or portals and personal or family homepages.

This AMI is built using the latest versions of Apache, MariaDB database and PHP on the target operating system patched with updates. The MariaDB database is secured to prevent any unwanted access for increased security. When a machine is spun up using this AMI Joomla would be up and running and ready for configuring for your specific requirements.

    *   Host: `localhost`
    *   Database Name: `joomla`
    *   Database User: `joomla`
    *   Database Password: `Instance ID` of the EC2 instance.
*   Note that FTP service is not enabled on this machine by default and you need to manually configure it, if that is required.
