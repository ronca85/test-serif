Jenkins Build Slave
===================

In a Jenkins based CI/CD pipeline the Jenkins slaves are the work horses. A slave machine is configured to perform variety of tasks – compilation of application source code, executing playbooks and running a wide range of automation tasks.

The Kurian Jenkins slave AMI is preloaded with most of the popular tools that are required to run such automations tasks:

*   Git Client
*   Ant
*   Maven
*   Gradle
*   Java OpenJDK 8 as the default Java version
*   OpenJDK releases from 9 through 14.
*   C/C++ compilers
*   Go compiler
*   Python 2.7 and 3.x
*   Docker
*   Node.js
*   Ansible
*   AWS CLI
*   kubectl

All the tools are installed following official guidelines so you don’t need to deal with any custom environment and you can build on the baseline build platform available on this AMI.

The build slaves spun up from this AMI work the best with Jenkins server created from Kurian’s AMI for [Jenkins Server](https://github.com/kurianinc/ami-pub/wiki/Jenkins-2.x-AMI-by-Kurian). AMIs are available for all the major Linux distributions.

========================================================================================================

In a Jenkins based CI/CD pipeline, the Jenkins jobs can be configured to run on a slave host, and that is the best practice. On the Jenkins server side the build slaves are called nodes. A node can be configured to work with Jenkins server different ways and for the details look at the section on configuration.

Kurian releases latest, stable versions of open source software on popular Linux distributions. If you need a configuration that is not currently available in marketplace, send us your requirements to [contact@kurianinc.us](mailto:contact@kurianinc.us). Please include the following info in the email:

*   Name of Software to be on the AMI with version numbers.
*   Linux distribution and the version.
*   The EC2 instance type you plan to spin up from the AMI (optional).

[](https://github.com/kurianinc/ami-pub/wiki/Jenkins-Build-Slave-AMI-by-Kurian#configuration)Configuration
==========================================================================================================

A host can be configured as a Jenkins slave by running `agent.jar` on it and connecting the agent service to the Jenkins server. The connectivity could be initiated from Jenkins server or from the slave. There are multiple methods available and few popular methods are summarized here. The Kurian Jenkins Build Slave is compatible with any method you prefer.

After spinning up the EC2 node using this AMI use one of the following methods to configure it as a build node on the Jenkins server. The Jenkins servers built from Kurian AMIs are the best suited for building CI/CD infrastructure.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   Generate a SSH key pair without passphrase. (It’s OK to have a passphrase actually but the setup would little easier without one. It’s up to your local security norms.)
    
*   An SSH credential to access slave node from Jenkins server must be setup using the private key generated in the last step. For this, navigate to Jenkins -> Credentials -> System and click `Add credentials` under `Global credentials` dropdown.
    
    *   Select `SSH Username with private key` as `Kind`
    *   `jenkins` as `Username`.
    *   In the `Private Key` field, use `Enter directly` option to add the content of private key.
*   In the new node creation window, choose these options:
    
    *   `/var/jenkins` as `Remote root directory`.
    *   `Launch agents via SSH` as `Launch method`.
    *   Use private IP or public IP as `Host` depending on how Jenkins server to slave node SSH access is configured.
    *   Select the credential created in the previous step (or existing) as `Credentials`.
    *   Choose `Manually trusted key Verification Strategy` as `Host Key Verification Strategy`.

[](https://github.com/kurianinc/ami-pub/wiki/Jenkins-Build-Slave-AMI-by-Kurian#launch-agent-on-slave-by-connecting-it-to-the-server)Launch agent on slave by connecting it to the server
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This allows the agent running on a slave node to be connected to the Jenkins master whenever it is ready. This means that the agent need not be reachable from the Jenkins server; the agent just needs to be able to reach the server. If you have enabled security via the Configure Global Security page, you can customize the port on which the Jenkins master will listen for incoming agent connections.

*   In the `Configure Global Security` page, under `Agents` -> `TCP port for inbound agents` select Fixed or Random port for inbound access from the agent. Make sure network access is provisioned for this inbound access accordingly.
*   Create a new node with `Launch method` selected as `Launch agent by connecting it to the master`. When clicked on the newly created node, you will be presented with multiple options as in the picture below:

*   SSH into the slave node and as user `jenkins`:

    $ cd /var/jenkins
    $ curl http://JENKINS-SERVER-IP:8080/jnlpJars/agent.jar -o agent.jar
    $ echo SECRET > SECRET-FILE
    $ java -jar /var/jenkins/agent.jar -jnlpUrl http://JENKINS-SERVER-IP:8080/computer/NODE-NAME/slave-agent.jnlp -secret @/var/jenkins/SECRET-FILE -workDir "/var/jenkins"
    

Verify that the agent is able to connect to Jenkins server successfully. To run the agent process on the slave node `agent.jar` can be run as a background process as follows:

    $ nohup java -jar /var/jenkins/agent.jar -jnlpUrl http://JENKINS-SERVER-IP:8080/computer/NODE-NAME/slave-agent.jnlp -secret @/var/jenkins/SECRET-FILE -workDir "/var/jenkins" &
    

[](https://github.com/kurianinc/ami-pub/wiki/Jenkins-Build-Slave-AMI-by-Kurian#automatically-provisioned-build-nodes-using-amazon-ec2-plugin)Automatically provisioned build nodes using Amazon EC2 plugin
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For detailed steps, refer this official documentation: [https://plugins.jenkins.io/ec2/](https://plugins.jenkins.io/ec2/). Make sure that it’s installed on the Jenkins server. This plugin is preinstalled in Kurian’s Jenkins Server AMIs.

These are the important points to note:

*   Add a new provisioner by selecting Jenkins -> Configure Clouds -> Amazon EC2
*   Have a Jenkins Credential item to store an AWS keys set that has privileges to spin up EC2 nodes and configure security groups. Select that as `Amazon EC2 Credentials`.
*   `EC2 Key Pair's Private Key` must correspond to the SSH key pair that will be used for communicating between Jenkins server and build slave node.
*   `AMI ID` must be the id of Kurian Jenkins Build Slave AMI.
*   `Security group names` should have AWS security group(s) that opens SSH accessing from Jenkins server to slave node on port 22.
*   `Remote user` must be `jenkins` and `Remote FS root` must be `/var/jenkins`. Both these are preconfigured already on the AMI.
*   Use `User Data` to inject the public key corresponds to `EC2 Key Pair's Private Key`. Use following command-line:

    #!/bin/bash
    echo "PUBLIC-KEY" >> ~jenkins/.ssh/authorized_keys
    chown jenkins:jenkins ~jenkins/.ssh/authorized_keys
    chmod 600 ~jenkins/.ssh/authorized_keys
    

Notes:

*   Replace `PUBLIC-KEY` with actual content of the public key.
    
*   Security groups for slave hosts must be configured to open the network inbound connection from Jenkins server.
    
*   Remote SSH access for `jenkins` user on the slave nodes must be ensured, such as configuring SELINUX settings on Red Hat Linux distributions.
    
*   `Connection Strategy` would depend on how the network access between Jenkins server host and the slave node is provisioned. The best practice is using `Private IP` as that is more secure.

==============================================================================================

As a best practice, in-place update of a Jenkins slave node is discouraged. The `agent.jar` file is downloaded from or pushed by (depending on the configuration method used) Jenkins server, and make sure the `agent.jar` runs on the slave node is compatible.

==================================================================================================================================

The communication between Jenkins master and slave host is over ssl and port 22 must be opened on the slave host for the Jenkins master.

The headless user is needed on the slave host for the communication between Jenkins master and slave. On the AMI `jenkins` has been setup for that purpose.

In addition, following are the standard AWS defined users available when a node is provisioned:

*   Amazon Linux: ec2-user
*   Red Hat Linux: ec2-user
*   SuSE Linux: ec2-user
*   Fedora: fedora
*   CentOS: centos
*   Debian Linux: admin
*   Ubuntu: ubuntu
