Secured MariaDB
===============

MariaDB is an open-source MySQL database compatible database and the Kurian AMI has the latest stable release of MariaDB installed for the targeted Linux platform. The installation is secured by running mysql\_secure\_installation.

==========================================================================================

The MariaDB database server is ready for use when an EC2 instance is spun from this AMI. An ideal resource to use with automated infrastructure provisioning when a MariaDB or MySQL database is needed as part of the cluster and available for use immediately.

============================================================================================

*   Besides running mysql\_secure\_installation for securing the database, no configuration is done.
*   SSH into the EC2 instance running the database as user specific to the operating system. See `Remote Access to EC2 Node` below to see the users listed.
*   Connect to the database as `root` using instance id as the password. If that doesn’t work try the password `dummypass`. Change password if needed.
