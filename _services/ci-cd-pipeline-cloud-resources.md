CI/CD Pipeline Cloud Resources by Kurian
========================================

  

Kurian has  a big portfolio of Linux AMIs with pre-configured software applications and they are widely used by system administrators and DevOps engineers. The Kurian AMIs are built by following official installation steps so any additional customization that might be required for running your workload is fairly simple to do.

A popular line of AMIs that Kurian lists in the AWS marketplace caters to building CI/CD pipelines using open-source and license-free components. (For these AMIs Kurian charges a nominal fee for packaging and the support.) Kurian AMIs pack CI/CD tools in a consistent manner on stable, current and patched Linux distributions.
