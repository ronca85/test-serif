Public Cloud Machine Image
==========================

**Kurian builds custom machine images to meet your specific requirements. There are two parts to such efforts:**

*   Public machine image for the public cloud platform that you have been using. For example if you like to add some third-party tools on our CIS hardened machine images that could be done.

*   If you like to publish your products in public cloud marketplaces such as AWS marketplace in the form of Â machine images, Kurian can take care of that. Such machines can either be listed by Kurian or directly you.
